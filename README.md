# Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images. Diabetic Retinopathy is a severe eye disease that can cause vision loss or blindness in individuals with diabetes. Early detection of this disease is crucial, and this project aims to automate the detection process, providing a reliable and accurate tool for identifying symptoms at an early stage.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify retinal images to detect signs of Diabetic Retinopathy. Using CNN, the model learns to identify patterns and abnormalities associated with the disease. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook file `DiabaticRetinopathydiseasedetectiont.ipynb` with the full code for training and evaluating the model.

## Key Features

- **Automated Detection**: Detects Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images, which can assist in early diagnosis and treatment.
- **High Accuracy**: Uses a deep learning approach (CNN) to achieve high classification accuracy.
- **Accessible and Scalable**: The model can be adapted and scaled to handle larger datasets for improved performance in real-world applications.

## Project Structure

- `DiabaticRetinopathydiseasedetectiont.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Dataset

This project requires a dataset of retinal images labeled for Diabetic Retinopathy. The dataset can be acquired from popular sources such as:
- **Kaggle**: [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection) or [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection).
- **EyePACS**: Offers public datasets with different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy.

Ensure to preprocess the images (resizing, normalization, etc.) before feeding them into the model.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AlinaBaber/Diabatic-Retinopathy-Disease-Detection-by-CNN.git
cd Diabatic-Retinopathy-Disease-Detection-by-CNN
```
- **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary libraries using pip.

- **Download the Dataset:** Acquire and organize your dataset in a directory structure suitable for training (e.g., train/ and test/ folders).

- **Run the Notebook:** Open DiabaticRetinopathydiseasedetectiont.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and follow the cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

- **Model Evaluation:** Use the evaluation metrics in the notebook to analyze the performance of the CNN model on test images.

## Model Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network model for this project consists of:

- **Convolutional Layers:** For feature extraction from retinal images.
- **Pooling Layers:** To down-sample the extracted features.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** For classification of images as showing Diabetic Retinopathy or healthy.
This architecture may be fine-tuned based on dataset requirements and model performance.

## Results
The model aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying images with or without Diabetic Retinopathy. Detailed results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided in the notebook.

## Future Improvements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further tuning can improve model accuracy and robustness.
- **Data Augmentation:** Additional data and augmentation techniques can help the model generalize better.
- **Advanced Architectures:** Experimenting with other deep learning architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet, or VGG could yield better results.
